*BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ ðŸ§ *

## Introduction

This second set of exercises is a bit more interesting. We'll be learning the basics of memory allocation in C++, references, pointers, and a rough look at switches.

## ex00. BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

This first exercise asks us to simply create a bunch of classes with basic methods we will use in future exercises in the module. We must have two ways of allocating instances of the class: either on the stack or on the heap, and free the allocated space at the right time.

## ex01. Moar brainz!

This second exercise consists of creating a method that will summon **N** zombies in one go, without naming each one of them. Then they all announce themselves and are properly destroyed.

## ex02. HI THIS IS BRAIN

This next exercise is super simple, it only aims to differentiate between pointers and references

## ex03. Unnecessary violence

This one extends the concepts of references and pointers from the previous exercise, creating two types of humans in two classes that can attack each other with different weapons.

## ex04. Sed is for losers

This exercise aims to replicate the basic performance of the **sed** command (**s**tream **ed**itor), receiving a file and a string to replace with another. It saves the output to a file with the same name ending in *.replace*. This exercise helps us understand file streams and strings in C++.

Note: the example above shows how the replace operation is reversible (unsurprisingly).

## ex05. Karen 2.0

The next two exercises expand on the idea of refernces a bit further. We create a **Karen** class that can give various messages of types **DEBUG**, **INFO**, **WARNING** and **ERROR**. We are asked to create that outputs the proper message depending message type.

## ex06. Karen-filter

This last exercise is an extension of the previous one. However this time we receive the message type from the user and output that type's message and all the message types above it (order is **DEBUG** < **INFO** < **WARNING** < **ERROR**). We must coordinate the responses using switches for this exercise.

Note how the **DEBUG** message is not shown because it is below **INFO**.

## Summary
This one was definitely harder than the previous one, but it was still pretty fun.
