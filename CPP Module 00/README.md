# CPP-Module-00 | 42 Madrid

*shhhhh... I think the students are asleep ðŸ“£*

## Introduction

This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things *will* start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

## ex00. Megaphone

This first exercise is quite simple, we are asked to create a program that takes arguments and prints them back to the terminal in capital letters. If no arguments are provided the program will print out a default message, also in captial letters.

## ex01. My Awesome PhoneBook

This second exercise is a bit more fun. We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can **ADD** or **SEARCH** for contacts, and we can also **EXIT**, clearing the list of contacts and ending the program. The phonebook can receive up to 8 contacts, such that the 9th contact will replace the 1st contact, the 10th will replace the 2nd, and so on.

## ex02. The Job Of Your Dreams

In this third and last exercise we are given two files which will help us build a class and all the necessary static and member functions so that the provided main function in **tests.cpp** creates the same output as the file **19920104_091532.log** (save the different timestamps). Our job is to figure out what the functions do to create the appropriate file **Account.cpp**. We are also given the header file containing the class definition in **Account.hpp**.
