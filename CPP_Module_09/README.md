# Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

## About project

Exercise 00 involves handling CSV files, reading input data, performing calculations, and outputting results. Error handling and the use of at least one container are emphasized in this exercise. The provided examples cover scenarios such as file opening errors, invalid input, and large numbers.

# Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

## About project

Exercise 01 focuses on implementing a program that evaluates mathematical expressions in reverse Polish notation. The program should support basic operations and provide meaningful error messages. The requirement to use at least one container encourages the use of data structures for handling tokens and results. The examples cover various RPN expressions and error scenarios.

# Exercise 02: PmergeMe

## About project

Exercise 02 involves implementing a sorting program using the merge-insert sort algorithm for a positive integer sequence. The use of two different containers emphasizes exploring various data structures for sorting. The program displays both the unsorted and sorted sequences and measures the time taken for sorting with each container. Error handling is also a crucial aspect of the exercise.
