## About this Module
The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in closer contact with inheritance for classes:
- ex00: Introduction to static casting and conversion of scalar types
- ex01: Serialization and reinterpret casting
- ex02: Identification of real types of classes via dynamic casting


All of those exercises are compilable with the `-std=c++98-flag`, since this was a requirement for this project.<br>
All exercises where compiled and tested on `macOS Catalina 10.15.7` and `Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS`.


All exercises can be compiled from the root of the exercise with `make`, `make all` or `make re`.<br>
All exercises have a main function to demonstrate all the abilities of the subject.<br>
After that, run the created executable like `./executable_to_run` (ie. ex00 `./convert <some_input_to_convert>`).<br>
