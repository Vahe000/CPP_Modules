# CPP-Module-02

My solution for CPP Module 02 of the Common core of 42 school.

## About this Module
The Scope of this Module was to get to know C++ further and come in contact with classes in orthodox canonical form:
- ex00: class that can store a fixed point variable
- ex01: add constructors and functions to that class from ex00 to make it usable
- ex02: add all kinds of operator overloads to expand the usability of ex01 even more
- ex03: a use case which uses most of the previously written code by creating a function that can determine weither a point is inside a triangle or not
